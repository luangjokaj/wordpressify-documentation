# Auto Deploy

To automatically deploy your WordPressify project, you can use GitHub Actions.

## GitHub Actions

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your WordPressify project.
2. Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file in the root directory of your project: <code>.github/workflows/deploy.yml</code>.
3. Copy the following code into the workflow file:

```yaml
name: Deploy WordPressify
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
env:
  THEME_NAME: ${{ vars.THEME_NAME }} # Define theme name as environment variable

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Build theme
        run: |
          npm run export

      - name: Set permissions
        run: |
          sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./dist
          chmod -R 755 ./dist
          mkdir -p dist/themes/${{ env.THEME_NAME }}
          touch dist/themes/${{ env.THEME_NAME }}/.ftp-deploy-sync-state.json
          chmod 666 dist/themes/${{ env.THEME_NAME }}/.ftp-deploy-sync-state.json

      - name: Deploy to WordPress
        uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@v4.3.4
        with:
          server: ${{ secrets.FTP_SERVER }}
          username: ${{ secrets.FTP_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
          local-dir: ./dist/themes/${{ env.THEME_NAME }}/
          server-dir: /public_html/wp-content/themes/${{ env.THEME_NAME }}/
          exclude: |
            **/.git*
            **/.git*/**
            **/node_modules/**
            **/src/**
            gulpfile.js
            package.json
            package-lock.json
```

- Make sure to add <code>FTP_SERVER</code>, <code>FTP_USERNAME</code>, and <code>FTP_PASSWORD</code> to your GitHub repository's secrets.
- Make sure to add <code>THEME_NAME</code> to your GitHub repository's variables. This is the name of your WordPress theme directory.
- Make sure to double check the <code>server-dir</code> path in the FTP-Deploy-Action step. This is the path to your WordPress theme directory on your server.
-  Make sure to have an empty file in the <code>src/plugins</code> directory. If the directory is empty, the deployment will fail.

## Triggering the Deployment

4. Commit and push your changes to the <code>main</code> branch.
5. Your WordPressify project will now automatically deploy to your WordPress site whenever you push changes to the main branch.

# Setup GitHub Actions

Here's how to set up both the theme name variable and all required secrets for the workflow:

**Go to your GitHub repository settings:**

- Click on "Settings" tab in your repository
- Click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"


**Set up the theme name variable:**

- Click on "Variables" tab
- Click "New repository variable"
- Create variable:
  - Name: <code>THEME_NAME</code>
  - Value: Your theme name  (e.g., "my-awesome-theme")


**Set up the FTP secrets:**

- Click on "Secrets" tab
- Click "New repository secret"
- Add these three secrets:

```
FTP_SERVER
Value: your-domain.com or ftp.your-domain.com

FTP_USERNAME
Value: your-ftp-username

FTP_PASSWORD
Value: your-ftp-password
```

### Remember:

- Secrets are encrypted and can't be viewed once saved
- You can update secrets anytime by creating a new one with the same name
- The workflow will automatically use the updated values
- Never commit these credentials to your repository
