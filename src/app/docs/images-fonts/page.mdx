# Images and Fonts

It is advisable to store template image assets within your theme directory at:

```bash
src/assets/img/
```

For optimal performance and organization, it is recommended to manage other images through the Media Library of WordPress. To maintain a lightweight template, consider storing only SVG or minimal assets in your theme directory. This practice helps streamline the theme's loading speed and overall efficiency. This refined version maintains a professional tone while emphasizing the importance of strategic image asset management within the WordPress theme directory.
