# Introduction

WordPressify is a development tool that simplifies WordPress theme and plugin creation:

- Development Server: Runs PHP under a proxy with BrowserSync.
- Database: Utilizes a pre-configured MariaDB database.
- Real-time Updates: Watches for changes and reloads the webpage instantly.
- Preprocessing: Styles with PostCSS or Sass, JavaScript with Babel compiler.
- Customization: Supports source maps, external libraries, npm scripts, and gulp tasks.

WordPressify is compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux, requiring only Docker as the primary dependency.
