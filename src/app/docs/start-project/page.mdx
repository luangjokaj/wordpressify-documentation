# Start project
Prior to proceeding, ensure that Docker is operational to prevent any failures.

The main file structure includes essential directories and files that are crucial for managing the WordPress theme development workflow. Here is a breakdown of the key components to highlight:

- **Theme Folder (src/theme/)** <br /> This directory contains PHP/HTML template files that define the structure and layout of the WordPress theme.
- **Plugins (src/plugins/)** <br /> This directory houses all custom-developed plugins specifically tailored for the WordPress theme. Custom plugins can be created and stored within this folder to extend the functionality and features of the theme.
- **CSS (src/assets/css/)** <br /> Contains CSS files responsible for styling the theme.
- **Fonts (src/assets/fonts/)** <br /> Stores font files used in the theme for text styling.
- **Images (src/assets/img/)** <br /> Holds image utilized within the theme design.
- **JavaScript (src/assets/js/)** <br /> Contains JavaScript files that provide interactivity and dynamic functionality.

These directories play a crucial role in organizing and managing the various assets and components of the WordPress theme. Additionally, the repoository includes configuration files, build files, distribution files, and Docker-related files to streamline the development process effectively.

# Change Template Name
Before starting, customize your template name by creating renameing **.env_example** to **.env** and replace the variable name.

```bash
# If you want to connect to BrowserSync on a different port. Default: 3010
PROXY_PORT=3010

# Theme name. Default: "wordpressify"
THEME_NAME=wordpressify
```

# Start Workflow
To initiate the development server, use the following command:
```bash
npm run start
```

If NodeJS is not installed locally, utilize Docker commands:


```bash
docker compose up
```

Ensure Docker is running to avoid any command failures.

# Rebuild Environment
To rebuild the WordPressify environment with a fresh installation and clean database, run:

```bash
npm run rebuild
```

For non-local NodeJS installations, use Docker commands:

```bash
docker compose down -v && docker compose build
```

# WordPress Plugins

For adding or building WordPress plugins, navigate to the directory:

```bash
src/plugins
```

# Production Template

To generate distribution files, execute:

```bash
npm run export
```

For non-local NodeJS setups, use Docker commands:


```bash
docker compose run --rm nodejs npm run prod
```

The template will be saved as a zip file in:

```bash
dist/wordpressify.zip
```

You are now equipped to delve into your WordPress development journey. Happy coding!
