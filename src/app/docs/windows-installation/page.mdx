# Windows Installation

To ensure WordPressify runs consistently across all platforms (Linux, Windows, and macOS), it is essential to have Docker installed. Docker provides a standardized environment for running applications, ensuring uniformity in performance regardless of the operating system. By having Docker installed, WordPressify can maintain its functionality seamlessly cross platform.

# Enviroment Variables

WordPressify on Windows requires the following environment variable to be set, you can do that by editing the <code>.env</code> file:

```bash
# Use polling for file watcher. Default: false
# Windows users should set this to true
USE_POLLING=true
```

Change the value of <code>USE_POLLING</code> to <code>true</code> to enable polling. This will ensure that the file watcher works correctly on Windows.
